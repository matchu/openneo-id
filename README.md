OpenNeo ID
==========

A very basic login system to plug into OpenNeo services, using the
[OpenNeo Auth Server][1] library to get the job done.

To the hackers:
---------------

OpenNeo services contain very little information valuable to you, and upon
registration for OpenNeo ID, users are specifically instructed *not* to use
their Neopets password. There's nothing here for you; your ill-natured efforts
would be better spent elsewhere.
